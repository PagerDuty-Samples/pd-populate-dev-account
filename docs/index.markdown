Welcome to the PagerDuty Terraform example account resource repository. In this project, you will find resources for building out PagerDuty configurations using Terraform.

There are two ways to use this project:
* I know what I'm looking for, take me to the [Terraform](https://github.com/PagerDuty-Samples/pd-populate-dev-account)!
* I'm not sure what I need, take me to the [story](acme).
* Show me how to translate the story into [PagerDuty resources](resources).
